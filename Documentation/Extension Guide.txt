Creating additional actions for LibCSL to parse and render is simple.  The steps are listed below.

1.  Inherit a class from LibcSL.Actions.Action.
2.  Override the parse method
3.  Modify CSLParser.cs
4.  Override the execute method


==========================================
	Writing an Action Parser
==========================================

Try to keep the syntax for your new action similar
to the default actions.  If it includes too many
different variables, try splitting it into two
actions.  Remember - simplicity is one of LibCSL's
goals!

All action parsers should override the parse method,
inherited from Action.cs.  Your method should accept
a single string - the entirety of the line containing
the action. The techniques, etc. that you use to write 
your parser are totally up to you, so just use whatever 
works, and try to keep it fast and efficient.



==========================================
	Modifying CSLParser.cs
==========================================

To make the main parser accept your action when it
is read, you need to modify the extractActions method.
Add an "if" statement like the following, replacing
the necessary parts for your custom action.


	If (curLine.StartsWith("ActionKeyWord"))
	{
		actions.Add(new ActionName());
		actions[actionCount].parse(curLine);
		actionCount++;
	}


==========================================
	Writing the Execute Method
==========================================

renderer!
